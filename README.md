# Three Vite Starter

A super minimal [threejs](https://threejs.org/) starter project with [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/). Just clone it and get started in seconds.

## Usage

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn

# Run the local server at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# Build for prod in /dist folder
yarn build
```

To customize the server check out the `vite.config.js` documentation [here](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Note

I also made a starter project for shaders.

```bash
# Just switch to the shader branch
git checkout shader

# Or clone the shader branch directly
git clone -b shader https://github.com/soumakdev/three-vite-starter.git
```
